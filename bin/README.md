The intent of this project is to create a usable app for non-commercial use. If you are interested in contributing to this effort on that basis, I'll be happy to concider pull requests to help improve features or fix bugs.

## App layout
The app will make use of several pages, using React Router functionality. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-react-router-include-router-hooks/

State will be passed through the app via the react-router-dom Link component. Then accessed using useLocation(). https://dev.to/maxcell/react-router-using-location-state-for-custom-ui-navigation-2ia9?utm_source=pocket_mylist
